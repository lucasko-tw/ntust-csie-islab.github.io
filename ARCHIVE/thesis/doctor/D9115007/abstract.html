      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;近年來類神經網路與支持向量機等機器學習理論，被大量的使用於各類生物資訊問題的預測上，雖然可得到較高的準確度，但其最大
的問題在於上述理論並不夠通透，無法深入的探究為什麼會得此結果，並進行進一步的分析。如目標殘基與其相鄰殘基間彼此之合作
與競爭關係對預測之影響等。故於此論文中我們提出建構樣式字典與多線性迴歸分析法兩個理論，藉助此兩個理論進行一系列的統計
分析，將有助於我們能更深入的瞭解，蛋白質殘基間之交互作用對溶劑可接觸面積的影響。
另一方面由於溶劑可接觸面積之預測，至今可分為兩大分支，既傳統的兩類別(或數個類別)的預測及實際值的預測。於本論文中我們
提出了一個全新的預測系統，我們將此系統命名為SVM-Cabins。本系統先利用由蛋白質演化資訊所得的位置加權矩陣為特徵值，接著
以累進切割集的切割方式，利用某一門檻值來進行傳統的兩類別切割，而後再以支持向量機針對不同的切割集，作溶劑可接觸面積之
兩類別的預測，最後我們再將所得的所有切割集的兩類別預測結果，映射成溶劑可接觸面積之實際值。上述系統當我們採用13個不同
的累進切割集來做預測，針對Barton502資料集，可達到平均絕對誤差15.1%及相關係數0.66，此預測之準確度為至今最佳的結果。由
於本系統先採用傳統的兩類別預測，再導入至實際值之預測，故本系統可同時達到對兩類(既傳統及實際值預測)之最佳化。本系統之
理論亦可以利用於任何預測之值介於一數值範圍間的所有問題。</p>

      <h4>Abstract</h4>

	
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thesis describes the result of our research in developing FAQ-master as an intelligent Web information system. 
The system is developed to perform intelligent discovery, retrieval, filtering, proxy, ranking and presentation of 
Web information to provide high-quality FAQ solutions to meet user information request. By a high quality answer we 
mean an answer that is profound, up-to-date, and relevant to the user’s question. We summarized problems into: how 
to faithfully capture user intention, how to effectively discover and aggregate Web information, how to present the 
relevant result to the user, and how to provide efficient proxy mechanism to help speed up the turn around time. We 
propose the following techniques to tackle the above issues: ontology, user models, website models, and data 
aggregation and proxy mechanisms. Based upon the techniques, FAQ-master was developed to contain four agents, 
namely, Interface Agent, Proxy Agent, Answerer Agent, and Search Agent, which can effectively and efficiently 
improve the search result from the following three aspects of the Web search activity, namely, user intention, 
document processing, and website search.
The Interface Agent was developed to work as an assistant between the user and FAQ system for capturing true user’s 
intention. Based on user modeling, template-based and ontology-supported techniques, the agent can support natural 
language query, enhanced by the pattern-match and template-based technique; assistance and guidance for human-
machine interaction; and better personalized information services. It also handles user feedback on the suitability 
of the proposed responses. The Proxy Agent was developed to work as a two-tier mediator between the Interface Agent 
and backend Answerer Agent. It employs an ontology-enhanced intelligent proxy mechanism to effectively alleviate the 
overloading problem usually associated with a backend server. The Answerer Agent was developed to help clean, 
retrieve, and transform FAQ information collected from a heterogeneous environment, such as the Web, and stores it 
in an ontological database. It works as a back end process to perform ontology-directed information aggregation, 
supported by the wrapper technique, from the webpages collected by the Search Agent. Finally, the Search Agent was 
developed to work as an both user-oriented and domain-related Web information retrieval with the help of ontology-
supported website models. This approach provides a semantic level solution for the Search Agent so that it can 
provide domain-specific, focused Web information discovery toward a high degree of user satisfaction.
Our first contribution is on the techniques of user modeling and query processing involved in the development of 
Interface Agent, which features ontology-supported, template-based user modeling technique and query processing. Our 
preliminary experimentation demonstrates that user intention and focus of up to eighty percent of the user queries 
can be correctly understood by the system. In addition, from the experiments we verify the robustness of the 
linguistic pattern match technique by demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing users’ query intention and 
focus.
The second contribution is on the techniques of query prediction in Proxy Agent. The agent features following 
interesting points. First, it performs fast user-oriented mining and prediction by discovering frequent queries and 
predicted queries from user query history. The improved sequential pattern mining algorithm is made more efficient 
by the techniques of perfect hashing and database decomposition. Second, it performs ontology-directed case-based 
reasoning. The semantics of PC ontology, in particular the VRelationships, are used in determining similar cases, 
performing case adaptation, and case retaining. Our experiments show that the agent can share up to 70% of the query 
loading from the backend process, which helps a lot on the overall query performance.
The third contribution is on the techniques of organizing and processing unstructured Web information in Answerer 
Agent. The agent employs ontology as the key technique, supported by the wrapper techniques to help clean, retrieve, 
and transform unstructured FAQ information collected from a heterogeneous environment, and stores it in an 
ontological database, which reflects the ontological structure. When it comes to the retrieval of FAQs, the agent 
trims irrelevant query keywords, employs either full keywords or partial keywords to retrieve FAQs, and removes 
conflicting FAQs before turning the final results to the user, all of which are supported by ontology. In addition, 
to producing a more effective presentation of the search results, the agent employs an enhanced ranking technique, 
which includes Appearance Probability, Satisfaction Value, Compatibility Value, and Statistic Similarity Value as 
four measures with proper weights to rank the FAQs. Our experiments show the Agent does improve the precision rate 
and produces better ranking results.
The final contribution is on the techniques of reflecting both user-oriented and domain-focused aspects in web 
search in Search Agent. The agent features an ontology-supported website modeling technique to provide a semantic 
level solution for a search engine so that it can provide fast, precise and stable search results with a high degree 
of user satisfaction. The website modeling technique closely connected to the domain ontology, which supports the 
following functions in both website model construction and application: query expansion, webpage annotation, 
webpage/website classification, and focused collection of domain-related and user-interested Web resources. The 
agent features the following interesting characteristics. 1) Ontology-supported construction of website models. By 
this, we attribute domain semantics into the Web resources collected and stored in the local database. One important 
contribution here is the new Ontology-supported OntoClassifier which can do very accurate and stable classification 
on webpages to support more correct annotation of domain semantics. Our experiments show that Ontoclassifier 
performs very well in obtaining accurate and stable webpages classification. 2) Website models-supported web 
resource discovery. By this, we take into account both user interests and domain specificity. The contribution here 
is the new Focused Crawler which employs progressive strategies to do user query-driven webpage expansion, 
autonomous website expansion, and query results exploitation to effectively expand the website models. 3) Website 
models-supported Webpage Retrieval. By this, we leverage the power of ontology features as a fast index structure to 
locate most-wanted webpages for the user.
