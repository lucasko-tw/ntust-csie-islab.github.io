        在機器學習中，樣本學習方法扮演著相當重要的角色。在此類的學習方法中，有幾個關鍵問題極為重要，包含空屬性值的處理、相似函數的選擇以及訓練樣本的選取及縮減等。在本論文中，我們首先提出一個植基於灰關聯分析的方法以預測分類問題中各樣本的空屬性值，在填補這些空屬性值後，進而處理分類問題。在本論文中，我們也提出一個以灰關聯結構為基礎的樣本學習方法，樣本間的相似性透過灰關聯分析來測定。另外，我們亦提出基於上述灰關聯結構所衍生的樣本選取方法，藉由分析樣本間的灰關聯結構以達縮減訓練樣本數的目的。依序整合以上所提方法後可成功地解決上述一般樣本學習方法中的問題。</font>

        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <font FACE="Times New Roman">
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">In recent years, instance-based learning (IBL) has 
        gained great popularity in machine</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">learning. In IBL, a training set of labeled instances is 
        first collected in the learning system. A</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">new, unseen instance is then classified according to its 
        ‘nearest’ training instance or instances.</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">This dissertation focuses mainly on these three key 
        issues in IBL, including missing attribute</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">values, similarity functions and partial memory 
        learning. First, this study proposes a</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">grey-based nearest neighbor approach to handle 
        incomplete data problems. Here, grey</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">relational analysis is employed to determine the nearest 
        neighbors of an instance with missing</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">attribute values. Thus, the valid attribute values 
        derived from these nearest neighbors are used</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">to predict those missing values. Experimental results 
        indicated that the proposed approach</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">outperforms other alternative methods. Furthermore, the 
        proposed method was evaluated using</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">five classification problems with incomplete data. 
        Experimental results revealed that the</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">accuracy of classification can be maintained or even 
        increased by applying the proposed</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">method beforehand.</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">In this dissertation, an instance-based learning 
        approach based on grey relational structure</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">is also proposed. Grey relational analysis is used to 
        precisely describe the entire relational</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">structure of all instances in a specific application 
        domain. By using the above-mentioned grey</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">relational structure, new instances can be identified 
        with high accuracy. Experiments</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">performed on forty application domains are reported to 
        demonstrate the performance of the</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">proposed approach. It can be easily seen that the 
        proposed approach yields high performance</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">over other methods that adopt one of Euclidean metric 
        and the Value Difference Metric (VDM)</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">or both. Moreover, it can be easily seen that the 
        proposal presented here can yield satisfactory</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">performance, compared to other classification 
        algorithms.</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, this study also proposes a novel partial 
        memory-learning approach based on</p>
        </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">III</p>
        </font><font FACE="Times New Roman">
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">grey relational structure. Grey relational analysis is 
        used to precisely describe the entire</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">relational structure of all instances in a specific 
        application domain. By using the</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">above-mentioned grey relational structure, instances 
        having no or few inward edges can be</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">eliminated prior to learning (i.e., these instances are 
        rarely used in determining the class labels</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">of other instances and thus can be pruned in a learning 
        system). Accordingly, a suitable training</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">subset with small size can be obtained for classifying 
        new instances. Experiments performed</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">on five application domains are reported to demonstrate 
        the performance of the proposed</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">approach. It can be easily seen that the proposed 
        approach yields high performance with small</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">size of training set, compared with other existing 
        pruning techniques.</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">Notably, the proposed partial-memory learning method is 
        an extended version of the</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">above instance-based learning approach. In these two 
        learning approaches, the relationships</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">among instances are determined according to the grey 
        relational structure (That is, grey</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">relational analysis is used to determine the ‘nearness’ 
        (or relationship) between two instances).</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, when classification tasks involve incomplete 
        data, the above grey-based nearest</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">neighbor approach for missing attribute value prediction 
        will be applied in advance in both of</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">the above two learning approaches. As a result, an 
        integrated instance-based learning approach</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">is proposed with capability of dealing with the 
        above-mentioned problems in IBL, including</p>
        <p ALIGN="LEFT">missing attribute values, similarity functions and 
        partial memory learning.</p>
